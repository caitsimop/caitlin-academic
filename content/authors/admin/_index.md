I am a Postdoctoral Associate in Bioinformatics in the Northomics lab at the University of Ottawa. Co-supervised by Dr Daniel Figeys and Dr Mathieu Lavallee-Adam, I'm currently studying the effects of drugs on the gut microbiome using metaproteomics. I'm interested in creating user-friendly bioinformatics tools for specialized data analysis. 

I'm also extremely passionate about science communication and outreach. I love volunteering as a mentor promoting gender equality in STEM fields, and promoting science literacy through open conversations and classroom visits.
