I'm Caitlin Simopoulos, a Postdoctoral Associate in Bioinformatics in the [NorthOmics lab](https://www.northomics.ca)  at the [University of Ottawa](https://med.uottawa.ca/bmi/en). Co-supervised by [Dr Daniel Figeys](https://med.uottawa.ca/bmi/en/people/figeys-daniel) and [Dr Mathieu Lavall√©e-Adam](https://med.uottawa.ca/bmi/en/people/lavallee-adam-mathieu), I'm currently studying the effects of drugs on the gut microbiome using metaproteomics. I'm interested in creating user-friendly bioinformatics tools for specialized data analysis. 

I'm also extremely passionate about science communication and outreach. I love volunteering as a mentor promoting gender equality in STEM fields and promoting science literacy through open conversations and classroom visits.
