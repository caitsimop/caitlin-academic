I'm Caitlin Simopoulos, a Senior Computational Biologist and Data Scientist at Recursion.
I love to use computational biology to make a difference in the world and to understand complex disease. 
Currently I'm interested in leveraging bioinformatics to improve drug discovery.

I'm also extremely passionate about science communication and outreach. I love volunteering as a mentor promoting gender equality in STEM fields and science literacy through open conversations and classroom visits.

When I'm not sciencing, you'll find me riding my bike, practicing yoga, snuggling with my cats, or taking my giant Bernese Mountain Dog for a hike!
